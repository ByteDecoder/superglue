# Demo Application

We have a non-trivial [demo] application built using BreezyJS and the original
[Rails and StimulusJS] version built by the talented [Sean Doyle] The intent is
to help you compare and contrast both approaches and showcase how enjoyable and
Rails-like Breezy/React/Redux can be.

We recommend going over the meticously verbose commit history on [Sean's
version] and comparing that with the [Breezy version].
