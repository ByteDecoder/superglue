# # Unreleased changes

## 0.10.0

- `withBrowserBehavior` has been renamed to `enhanceVisitWithBrowserBehavior` and only accepts one arg, the visit action creator.
- `remote` now has a fallback `pageKey` if one isn't provided.
- `ensureSingleVisit`, the function that powers `visit` is now exposed for use. Come in super handy when you want to create your own `visit` function. For example, instaclick functionality.
